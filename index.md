## The Goals Of The Tutorial

The tutorial is broken into three sections, or "units", each of which has a separate objective; each unit is broken into three "lessons" that take you part of the way towards the goal of the unit.

<ul>Unit 1</ul><br />
The first unit will teach you how to setup and configure the TravelPort Universal Api (uAPI) and how to make some basic requests through that API.  With this section complete, you can ask TravelPort for information about rail and air travel--such as schedules and availability--and of course get the prices associated with that travel.

<ul>Unit 2</ul><br />
The second lesson is about the common "agency workflows" or actions that travel agents have to perform regularly.  These include creating a booking for a passenger, finding hotel accommodation in an area, and manipulating the agents queue of tasks to perform.

<ul>Unit 3</ul><br />
The final unit will help you build a working [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) application that uses the uAPI to determine things like, "How much would it cost for me to visit my friend Joe on his birthday next month?".
