<h1>The TravelPort Universal API Tutorial</h1>

<h2>Tutorial structure</h2>

<p>This tutorial is broken into three large pieces called <em>units</em>.  Each unit has a large scale goal and three lessons that support the larger objective.</p>

<ul>Unit 1: Basics of Traveport's Universal API</ul>

<p>The first unit familiarizes the reader with how to work with TravelPort API, including setting up to use it, and how to make some basic API calls.  These API calls are ones involving searching for flights (or trains) and include getting availability, schedules, and prices.</p>

<ul>Unit 2: Understanding response objects</ul>

<p>The second unit gives the reader some experience with more advanced functionality in the TravelPort Universal API (uAPI) such as the ability to make and cancel bookings as well as other typical &ldquo;workflow&rdquo; associated with travel applications such as manipulating an agency queue.</p>

<ul>Unit 3: Facebook integration</ul>

<p>The final unit constructs a <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> application that uses the uAPI to perform functions that make sense in a social setting and integrate them with Facebook. These include the ability to perform functions like, &ldquo;show me the cheapest way to go visit Joe for his birthday&rdquo; or other such travel-and-social features.</p>
